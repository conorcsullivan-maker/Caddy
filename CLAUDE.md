## Running locally

**Frontend (port 3000):**
```
cd ~/Desktop/Caddy/caddy-web/frontend && npm run dev
```

**Backend (port 8000):**
```
cd ~/Desktop/Caddy/caddy-web/backend && source venv/bin/activate && python3 main.py
```

Frontend proxies `/api/*` to `localhost:8000` in dev. Local SQLite at `caddy-web/backend/caddy.db`.

**Env** (`~/Desktop/Caddy/.env`): `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOLF_COURSE_API_KEY`. Also `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=sullydakid` + `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PIN=6252` to seed the first admin on a fresh DB.

---

## Deployment

- **Backend** on Render → auto-deploys on push to `main`. Takes ~2-3 min; expect 502s during the swap.
- **Frontend** on Vercel → auto-deploys on push, usually <1 min.
- `.env` values are set as env vars in Render's dashboard. Production also sets `COOKIE_SECURE=true`, `DATA_DIR=/data`, `FRONTEND_ORIGIN=https://caddy-sepia.vercel.app`.

---

## Non-negotiable conventions

1. **Cookies / mobile Safari**: `/api/*` MUST be proxied through the frontend origin (`vercel.json` + `next.config.ts`). Cookies are first-party. Do NOT switch to CORS + third-party cookies — mobile Safari blocks them.
2. **`load_dotenv(override=True)`** in `main.py`: required because Conor's shell has an empty `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` set by Claude Desktop.
3. **Next.js 16 breaking changes**: read `caddy-web/frontend/AGENTS.md` and `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing Next.js code. Don't assume training-data patterns still work.
4. **Only recommend clubs in the player's bag** (hard rule in `caddy_engine.py:BASE_PROMPT`). If the yardage calls for a club they don't have, say so.
5. **Use the exact bag label** for wedges — never translate "Sand wedge" ↔ "56 wedge" or vice versa. The bag entry is the source of truth for what the player expects to hear.
6. **Confidence tiers** are computed in code (`caddy_trackman.shot_count_tier`), never in Claude's head. Prompt receives a pre-computed label like "HIGH CONFIDENCE" and uses it.
7. **Full conversation persistence** — `save_conversation` no longer truncates. `CLAUDE_CONTEXT_MESSAGES=60` in `caddy_engine.py` limits only what's sent to Claude per turn, not what's stored.
8. **Export allowlist** is hardcoded `{"sullydakid", "smiley"}` in main.py — deliberately not gated on `is_admin` so future admins don't silently get export rights.
9. **Claude Haiku wraps JSON in markdown fences.** `_extract_json` in `caddy_round.py` handles it — don't bypass.
10. **Partial-round `differential`** produces nonsense; the calc assumes 18 holes. Add a guard if we start supporting partial rounds properly.

## Data model highlights

**`users` table** — one row per player. Key columns:
- `bag TEXT` (JSON) — `{"driver": 310, "3-wood": 250, ..., "custom_chipper": 60}`
- `shot_stats TEXT` (JSON) — unified pooled shot data: `{club_label: {trackman: bucket, course: bucket}}`. Bucket shape: `{count, total_carry, sum_sq, best, worst, left, right, center}`. Direction only meaningful for on-course data.
- `trackman_session_ids TEXT` (JSON list) — for dedup on re-upload
- `conversation_history TEXT` (JSON) — active chat (persisted in full)
- `active_round_state TEXT` (JSON) — `{course, tee, hole_scores, current_hole, started_at, course_confirmed}`
- `tendencies_summary TEXT` — Claude-generated qualitative narrative (NO numbers — those are in `shot_stats`)

**`conversations` table** — archived chats. Every completed round → `kind='round'`. Every reset → `kind='casual'`. Never deleted.

**`sessions` table** — auth tokens (30-day cookies).

**`course_geometry` table** (auto-wind feature) — cached OSM per-course hole geometry. Keyed by `(source, course_id)`.

---

## Message pipeline (`process_user_message` in main.py)

Every player message flows through this:

1. End-of-round detection (short-circuits everything else)
2. Course rejection detection (unloads a mis-loaded course)
3. Course detection + load (fires OSM geometry fetch in background)
4. Tee change detection
5. Score detection + logging
6. Drive distance inference (from "remaining yardage" on known holes; auto-logs to shot_stats)
7. Course-note detection (hazards mentioned in passing)
8. Build system prompt context: course + score + weather + **computed relative wind (auto-wind)**
9. `caddy_reply` → Claude Opus response
10. Persist history + round state

Events (`round_state`, `weather`, `events: ChatEvent[]`) are returned to the frontend so the UI can render round bar, weather strip, alerts, and (new) auto-wind badge.

## Recent significant changes (chronological, most recent first)

**Test suite** *(2026-07-02, commit `f820281`)* — 94 pytest cases in `caddy-web/backend/tests/` covering the detection layer (score parsing, hole extraction, negations), wind math conventions, GPS yardage, and prompt helpers. Anthropic client stubbed to raise — tests never touch the network. Run: `cd caddy-web/backend && ./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/`. **Run these before touching caddy_round.py, caddy_geo.py, or caddy_engine.py helpers.**

**PWA icons** *(2026-07-02, commit `779d2b6`)* — icon-192/512 + maskable in manifest, Next file-convention `src/app/icon.png` + `apple-icon.png`.

**Auto-yardage (GPS rangefinder)** *(2026-07-02, commit `57ef05e`)* — player lat/lng × cached green centroids → `GPS YARDAGE` prompt block + `gps_yardage` chat event + "~152 yds to green" in the round bar. Player-stated yardage always wins over GPS. 5–700 yd sanity window.

**Latency pass** *(2026-07-02, commit `b6c8ace`)* — `might_mention_course()` pre-filter gates the per-message course-detection Haiku call; hazard-note Haiku moved to a background thread; weather cache-miss fetches forecast+alerts in parallel. Typical mid-round message: zero Haiku calls before the Opus reply.

**Auto-wind pipeline** *(committed + pushed 2026-07-02, commit `0d148be`; built 2026-05-24)* — `caddy_geo.py` fetches golf=hole/tee/green from OSM Overpass around a course's lat/lng (from golfcourseapi.com's own coordinates), spatially pairs tees + greens to their hole via containment in the hole polygon, computes tee→green bearing, and decomposes NWS wind into headwind/tailwind + crosswind from player POV. Cached per course in `course_geometry` table. Prompt gets a `COMPUTED RELATIVE WIND` block Claude must use verbatim; when unavailable it falls back to "ask once per hole, reuse the answer." Weather strip on `/caddy` shows an "auto" badge with the direction. Coverage of golfcourseapi.com sample: ~68% STRONG+PARTIAL. **Not yet validated on a live round.**

**Conversation .docx export** *(2026-05-21, commit `2b1d390`)* — owner-only download (Conor + Drew) for archived chats and the active chat. Endpoints allowlist-gated. Also fixed the latent bug where `save_conversation` was truncating history to 60 messages on every save (only the per-turn Claude context should be capped, not persistence).

**Bag-exact wedge labels + club-in-bag lock-down** *(2026-05-21, commit `c7c47cd`)* — Caddy must call wedges what the player entered them as, and can never recommend a club not in the bag.

**Admin CSV export** *(commit `2b3993b`)* — one-row-per-user beta engagement dump at `/api/admin/export.csv`.

**Custom-club bag setup** *(commit `f64e24d`)* — hybrids, 7-wood, "Add another club" for custom entries. Custom-key format: `custom_<name>`.

**Unified `shot_stats`** — pooled Trackman + on-course shot data. Confidence tiers computed in code.

## Where to look

- **Memory / cross-session context**: `~/.claude/projects/-Users-conorsullivan/memory/project_caddy.md`
- **Session transcripts**: search via `mcp__ccd_session_mgmt__search_session_transcripts` (deferred tool — load via ToolSearch first)
- **Live Overpass sanity check**: `/tmp/osm_holes.py` (throwaway; useful reference for query shape)
- **Drew's beta feedback template**: `~/Desktop/Caddy_Beta_Feedback_Drew.docx`
- **Product notes / idea binder generator**: `~/Desktop/Caddy/make_idea_binder.js` (`NODE_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules node ...`)

## Current priorities (as of 2026-07-02)

1. **⚠️ RENDER SERVICE SUSPENDED** — as of 2026-07-02 the backend at caddy-api.onrender.com returns 503 with `x-render-routing: suspend` (likely a billing lapse during Conor's June vacation). Only Conor can resume it in the Render dashboard. Until then the live beta is fully down (frontend loads, all API calls fail). On resume, Render should deploy the latest main.
2. **Validate auto-wind + auto-yardage on a live round** (Drew's next round).
3. **Approach-shot logging beyond driver** — parse "hit 7-iron from 145" out of player messages and log to `shot_stats[club].course`.
4. **Main.py refactor** — split into routers (auth/admin/chat/stats), fix JSON-column read-modify-write races, session expiry, unsalted PIN hashes. Tests exist now; safe to do.
5. **Trackman session deletion UI** (dedup column exists, no DELETE endpoint).
6. **Phone-camera lie-reading prototype** — extend the existing Claude vision path ("photo of your lie" → lie/trouble assessment folded into club advice). Groundwork for the wearable vision; no hardware needed.

Decided: iPhone app will be **React Native (Expo)**, built after the refactor stabilizes the API contract. Wearable (glasses) integration deliberately deferred until the RN app exists and lie-reading proves out. Long-term: terrain via USGS 3DEP, paired-play mode, Postgres at ~50 concurrent users.
